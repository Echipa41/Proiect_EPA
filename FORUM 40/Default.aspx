<p style="text-align:right">"The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights
in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not
be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living .

Of course I do not here speak of that beauty that strikes the senses, the beauty of qualities
and appearances; not that I undervalue such beauty, far from it , but it has nothing to do
with science; I mean that profounder beauty which comes from the harmonious order of
the parts, and which a pure intelligence can grasp."
